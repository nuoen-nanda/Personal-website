      <p>Hi Guys! I'm Timothy.  I have graduated from university and attained a social science degree a few years ago. Since then, I've worked different kinds of jobs but mostly commerical related and my current job is marketing executive. When I have free time, I enjoy doing reading. It allows me to relieve my pressures from my busy work and get to know new things. You know, the world has been changing rapidly, I have to keep myself open to new perspectives. Besides, I also enjoy travelling, hiking, listening to music. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Over time, I ask myself what do I want to acheive in future. Sometimes I find commercial jobs are not exactly what I want to dedicate to for my future career. I was a bit lost and frustrated. Serendipitously, I happened to know some of my friends self-studied programming succesufully and got a programming job . Then I asked myself "Hey! If they could do it, how about me? Am I capable of doing the same? After thorough consideration, I decided to give it a try. I set myself a year time of period. You know, life is short and I do not to live with regret.</p>

    <h2>Path to learning programming</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="content">
        <p>Thanks to technology advancement, there are unlimited programming resources I can search for on the internet. At the beginning, I have very little idea about programming. Therefore, I completed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcabW7890RKJzL968QWEykA">Havard CS50 course</a> to grab the basic idea of computer science and various kinds of languages including Scratch, C++, Java and Python, etc. The instructors illustrate the concept well. If you are new to programming, I recommended you to complete this course. After having a rough idea what programming is, it is the time to know <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-in-demand-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020-4462eb7d8d3e">the most popular languages at the moment</a>. In the meantime, I saw an article in medium introducing different platforms to learn programming lanague. There is one called CodeGym. It's a platform to learn Java. I was attracted by its teaching way. Wwe need to solve the tasks and level up ourselves. Thus I chose to learn Java finally. Together with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Eighth-Herbert-Schildt/dp/1260440214">Java: A Beginner's Guide</a>, I have learnt the basic syatax including array, loops, objects and if statement, etc. </p>

        <br>
        <p>After finishing ten levels of CodeGym course, I did not feel very right about Java and hesitated whether I should continue the study and consider to switch to a new language. Then I happened to come across more information about Javascript. I realized it together with HTML and CSS are very powerful languages to develop website. I thought I could make use of my marketing experiences to become a front-end programmer. Since then, I subscribed the membership of Codecademy as it offers a systematic course for becoming a front-end programmer. Currently I am learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV">Git and Github</a>, I believe that by learning it can enable me to share and learn with other programmer more efficiently and effectively.  And here this is my first proejct to apply what I have learnt so far! </p>
